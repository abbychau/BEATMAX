BEATMAX
=======

About
-----

Beatmax is my attempt to create a cross platform clone of the popular BeatMania/DJ Max style of rhythm games. It is written in C++ and currently/will use:

* SDL 
* OpenGL for graphics
* OpenAL for audio
* libvorbis, ffmpeg for decoding

Features
--------

Nothing has been completed, but I aim to have it:

* Working with all BMS/BME files
* Have a skinnable interface
* Working on most platforms (including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and iPad)
* Multiplayer (in the distant future)

Licence
-------

All the code is distributed under the FreeBSD license. 

Compiling
---------

Currently I've only written a Makefile for Mac OS X. More will be added in the future.
